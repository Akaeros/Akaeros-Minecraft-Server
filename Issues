Known Issues Currently Working On.


Occasional frame tear/freezing possibly do to server performance/client side optimization.
Mod conflict between mods causing a java overflow, forcing the client to crash and make joining back impossible.
Player model and armor clipping due to certain mods not being fully compatible with Epic Fights. (Mod Author issue.)
Server occasionally crashing from java overflow errors. (Possibly my fault for incompatible mods.)
Spawn protection making chests in spawn unusable for new players. (I shortened SP from 16 to 4, will test results.)
Server reset upon crashing, occasionally corrupting server world and making a new world. (Probably my fault due to mods.)

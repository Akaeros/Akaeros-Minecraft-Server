# RPGSMP-Server
A Beta package to join my RPG Multiplayer Server.

To join the server, you will first need Curseforge or the mod folder for the standard launcher.

Click "Create a Profile" at the top right, then click "Import"

Choose "Kaijuros_RPG_SMP-Beta.zip" and then click "Open".

It will then download all mods, configs and options.

All mod keybinds have been removed in game to let players choose their own keybinds for each mod.

Will progressively update modpack to be more challenging.

Modpack will be updated inconsistantly, all client mods must be updated by client.


[Kaijuros RPG-1.19.2-43.3.9 (Full Release).zip](https://github.com/KaijuroYT/Kaijuros-Minecraft-Server/files/14924468/Kaijuros.RPG-1.19.2-43.3.9.Full.Release.zip)


You will have to update all your mods manually when the download arrows appear.

(I do not own any mods in this modpack, no money is made from this modpack, all rights are reserved by mod authors.)

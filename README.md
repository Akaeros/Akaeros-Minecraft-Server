# GuncraftSMP-Server
A Beta package to join my Guncraft Multiplayer Server.

To join the server, you will first need Curseforge.
Click "Create a Profile" at the top right, then click "Import"
Choose "Vals_Guncraft_SMP-Beta.zip" and then click "Open".
It will then download all mods, configs and options.
All mod keybinds have been removed in game to let players choose their own keybinds for each mod.
